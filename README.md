# Problem-solving

This repository is my problem solving journal. Will contain the learnings gained from solving coding problems.

## Daily Practice

**Choose problems that:**
- Are difficult for your (and/or)
- Help you learn a new topic.

**During Practice:**
- Give yourself ~30 minutes **of being stuck** before reading editorial.
- If you do need the editorial, read it bit-by-bit and process it
- Code the solution once you understand it
- Note down what you're doing/thinking or as you do it

**General Info**
- Make sure you know how to use the big ideas/topics from solved problems.
- Treat every problem as a learning process
- Your practice will tell you what topics you need

## Tips for a Newbie (like me) ðŸ¤“

### Don't do this
1. Don't Learn complicated Data structures.
2. Focus on your level problems A and B.
3. Don't Stop Thinking if you still have ideas! Try yourself first.
4. Don't think on problem more than enough.
5. Don't Give up!

### Do this
1. Solve a lot of low difficult problems.
2. Implementations, Brute force and Mathematics tags.
3. You must reach 300 Accepts!
4. Participate in all CF Contests! Especially Div 3.
5. Read the codes of other people.
