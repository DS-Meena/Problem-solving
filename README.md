# Problem-solving
This repository is my problem solving journal. Will contain the learnings gained from solving coding problems.

## Mathematics

Sum of AP:

$sum = \frac{len}{2} * (\text{first term} + \text{last term})$

## Tips for a Newbie (like me)

### Don't do this
1. Don't Learn complicated Data structures.
2. Focus on your level problems A and B.
3. Don't Stop Thinking if you still have ideas! Try yourself first.
4. Don't think on problem more than enough.
5. Don't Give up!

### Do this
1. Solve a lot of low difficult problems.
2. Implementations, Brute force and Mathematics tags.
3. You must reach 300 Accepts!
4. Participate in all CF Contests! Especially Div 3.
5. Read the codes of other people.
